##YARRH! - Yet Another RepRap Host.
==========

##What is it?
Yarrh is new host software for RepRap type printers. Its written in C++ and Qt library.
Main new features will be:
- 3D view of printed object
- layer view for single and all layers
- calibration procedures for printer with automatic stepps per mm calculations
- integreated ui for slic3r
- predefined configs for slicing
- control for multiply extruders

Currently software is in early alpha, project was started 25.06.2012.
Its hardly usable at the moment, it works, but very poorly. At the moment is only proof of concept and needs lots of optymalization and work.

##How does it look?
You can see short demo of software running on youtube
